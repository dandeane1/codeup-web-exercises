// Warmup for today:
// Create a function called logUser. This function will accept a string argument and return a message that says “stringArgument has logged in for the day”. Console.log your results to verify the message.
// console.log(logUser(“ken2cool”)) // “ken2cool has logged in for the day.”
// 	Bonus:
// I. Refactor your message to use template strings.
// Ii. Add validation to make sure the argument passed to the function is a string datatype only.

function logUser(string){
    return (string) + "has logged in for the day.";

    }
console.log(logUser + "has logged in for the day.")
// “ken2cool has logged in for the day.”
    (logUser(ken))
